# Plan 051: Chat artifact cards, versions UI, and share links

> **Executor instructions**: Follow this plan step by step. Run every

## Status

- **Priority**: P2
- **Effort**: L
- **Risk**: HIGH (first anonymous-access surface; unguessable-token
  authorization; donor §4.6 rule: "treat as high-risk, small, and explicit")
- **Depends on**: hard — 050 (artifact revisions + CSP-locked serving), 030
  (jobs harness, DONE — sweep kind registration), Gate G3 (satisfied).
  Soft: 035 (files UI revision-diff
  component — reuse if landed, decision 10).
- **Category**: Phase 6 artifacts (roadmap `000_MASTER_ROADMAP.md` §4
  Phase 6 row 051; donor `DONOR_PORT_ROADMAP.md` §4.6 / §6 row F2)
- **Planned at**: commit `a0eea1c`, 2026-07-06

## Decisions taken

1. **Token scheme**: `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` — 256 bits of entropy,
   ~43 URL-safe chars, comfortably above the dictated ≥128-bit floor. The
   token is returned exactly once (share-creation response) and never
   stored: the row keeps `token_hash = hash_token(token)` (plain SHA-256
   hex, `utils/security.py:70-82`) plus an 8-char `token_prefix` for admin
   display. Plain SHA-256 (not a slow KDF) is correct here: the input is
   256-bit random, so offline brute force is infeasible and a slow hash
   would only tax the anonymous hot path. Lookup is a unique-index SELECT
   by `token_hash` — the comparison happens on the digest, so response
   timing does not vary with stored-token similarity ("constant-time-ish");
   uniform 404s (decision 3) close the rest of the enumeration surface.
2. **Version-pinned, always, in v1.** `version_id` is non-nullable and
   stamped with the artifact's `current_version_id` at share creation
   (dictated: pinned by default). A "follow latest" mode is deferred — it
   is a one-column relaxation later, and shipping it now would silently
   publish future revisions through old links. Recorded here so the
   deferral is deliberate.
3. **Enumeration resistance = uniform 404.** Unknown token, expired,
   revoked, artifact soft-deleted — all return the identical problem+json
   404 (typed `NotFoundError`) with no differentiating detail, body, or
   header. Expired/revoked shares are indistinguishable from tokens that
   never existed.
4. **Share-creation rate limit (governance §4: 10/hour/workspace)** rides
   the existing Postgres limiter unchanged. The limiter keys on
   `(ip, endpoint, limit_type, window)` and validates `ip` as an IP literal
   (`core/rate_limiting.py:96-109`), so a per-workspace (not per-IP) limit
   uses a documented sentinel: `check_rate_limit(ip="0.0.0.0",
   endpoint=f"artifact_share_create:{workspace_id}",
   limit_type="artifact_share_creation", custom_limit=10,
   custom_window=3600)`, wrapped in
   `services/artifacts/utils.py::check_workspace_share_rate_limit(db, workspace_id)`
   with a comment explaining the sentinel. No limiter schema or API change;
   if the limiter later grows a first-class subject key, migrate the
   wrapper. Blocked requests raise the existing `RateLimitError`
   (`core/rate_limiting.py:390-411` — RFC 7807 + `X-RateLimit-*`/
   `Retry-After` headers).
5. **Share-access rate limit (defense in depth, not governance-mandated)**:
   the anonymous route also applies
   `require_rate_limit(custom_limit=120, custom_window=3600)`
   (`core/rate_limiting.py:414-445`, per-IP) so token guessing and
   scraping are throttled beyond the global middleware limits. Recorded as
   a deviation-free addition (governance §4 names only the creation limit).
6. **Access audit is throttled by `last_accessed_at`**: every successful
   access does one atomic
   `UPDATE ... SET access_count = access_count + 1, last_accessed_at = now()`
   returning the previous `last_accessed_at`; an audit row (action `READ`,
   resource `artifact_share`, actor_type `SYSTEM`, actor_display
   `"anonymous"`, details = ip/user_agent/artifact_id) is written only when
   the previous value is NULL or older than 1 hour. Bounded audit volume
   (≤ 24 rows/share/day), zero extra state. Create and revoke are audited
   unconditionally (actor = the acting user). New enum:
   `AuditResourceType.ARTIFACT_SHARE = "artifact_share"`
   (`services/audit_events/enums.py:25-40`).
7. **Share tokens must never reach logs.** The token travels in the URL
   path (clean shareable link), but
   `middleware/request_logging.py:74` logs the raw `request.url.path`.
   This plan changes `_record_request` to log the matched route template
   (the `_endpoint_template_for_metrics` value, `request_logging.py:19-25`)
   instead of the raw path when the path starts with `/artifacts/shared` —
   a two-line, path-scoped redaction, pinned by a caplog test. Referer
   leakage is already closed by 050's `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`;
   cache leakage by `Cache-Control: no-store`.
8. **Sweep kind `artifacts.sweep_expired_shares`** (governance §3: shares
   hard-deleted at `expires_at`, default 7 d). Registered exactly like the
   landed precedent `services/jobs/handlers/sweep_deleted_files.py:20-56`
   (`@job_handler` + self-reschedule + `ensure_*` called from
   `workers/job_runner.py:28-48`). Hard-deletes rows where
   `expires_at < now()` — revoked rows included (they stay visible in the
   admin list as "revoked" until expiry, then vanish; audit rows survive
   per governance §3 law 2). Shares are NOT soft-deleted rows: revocation
   is the explicit `revoked_at` column, so the model composes
   `Base + UUIDMixin + TimestampMixin` (the `models/jobs.py` precedent),
   not `BaseModel`.
9. **Sharing is feature-gated and forces the separate origin in
   production.** New setting `ARTIFACT_SHARING_ENABLED` (default `False`).
   The production-safety validator (`core/settings/__init__.py:51`) gains:
   when `ARTIFACT_SHARING_ENABLED` and `ENVIRONMENT != "local"`,
   `ARTIFACT_ORIGIN` must be non-empty AND its host must differ from — and
   not be a subdomain of — the `APP_BASE_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL` hosts
   (pragmatic registrable-domain check via suffix comparison, documented
   as an approximation in the validator; no public-suffix dependency).
   This implements the roadmap decision "separate origin required only when
   share links ship" and 050's maintenance note. Share-creation requests
   while disabled fail with a typed validation error; the anonymous route
   404s (uniform).
10. **Roles**: share create/list/revoke are admin+ (`require_owner`, which
    is `MANAGER_ROLES` = owner+admin, `core/dependencies.py:267`) per
    governance §1 "Create/revoke artifact share links (051)". User artifact
    edits and restores are member+ (`require_editor`), matching the §1
    files row ("Upload/edit/delete files: member+"). Artifacts are a separate
    aggregate but use the same member+ editing policy. Frontend gating mirrors
    `workspace-settings-route.tsx:14` (`current_user_role === "owner" ||
    "admin"`).
11. **Diff/restore ride the landed revision chain.** Restore appends a NEW
    revision with `revision_kind="restore"` and
    `restored_from_revision_id` set (the `ArtifactRevision` CHECK in
    `models/artifacts.py` requires exactly that pairing), then bumps
    `Artifact.current_version_id` — never mutates history (immutability
    listener in `models/artifacts.py`). Diff is client-side: if 035 has
    landed a revision-diff component in `features/files/`, reuse it;
    otherwise ship a minimal unified line-diff helper in
    `features/artifacts/lib-diff.ts` (no new dependency — hand-rolled LCS
    is ~60 lines and knip-clean). Record which path was taken in the PR.
12. **User edits append revisions too** (dictated): `PATCH
    /api/v1/artifacts/{artifact_id}` takes `{content, title?}` and calls
    050's `update_artifact` service with user actor provenance
    (`created_by_user_id`, exactly-one-actor check in
    `models/artifacts.py`). v1 edit UI is a plain textarea dialog for
    the text types (html/markdown/mermaid/csv); no rich editor.
13. **The share link serves the raw document — no viewer wrapper page.**
    The anonymous URL IS 050's CSP-locked serving pipeline with a
    token-resolved version. A wrapper viewer on the app origin was
    rejected: it would need an anonymous app route plus a second
    anonymous content fetch — twice the surface for cosmetics. The share
    dialog copy says links open the document directly.
14. **An artifacts page ships** (`/artifacts`): decision recorded as YES.
    Rationale: share management is admin-facing and needs a home outside
    any one conversation; the roadmap's Surfaces pillar names artifacts a
    first-class screen ("versioned and diffable"); and orphaned artifacts
    (conversation deleted) would otherwise be unreachable. Kept dense and
    small: a table + a detail view; no gallery, no search in v1.
15. **Chat cards reuse `tool.call`/`tool.result` — no new SSE events.**
    The parser throws on unknown event names
    (`features/conversations/stream/sse.ts:73-75`). Artifact cards key off
    the tool activity (`name === "create_artifact" | "update_artifact"`)
    through the existing custom-row registry
    (`tool-call-row-registry.tsx:29-56`) — the same seam skills used in
    020. Previews are `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts" srcDoc={...}>` —
    never `allow-same-origin`, never `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, matching
    the roadmap's local-dev decision (srcdoc + sandbox; no separate origin
    needed for previews).

## Why this matters

050 makes artifacts exist; this plan makes them usable and — carefully —
shareable. Cards in chat close the loop for the person driving the agent
(see the report, flip versions, restore); the artifacts page closes it for
the workspace (find, audit, manage). Share links are the deliberate
high-stakes slice: the platform has never served anything to an
unauthenticated caller except HMAC-signed storage capabilities, and the
donor's history shows anonymous surfaces grown casually become incident
surfaces. Hence the posture: one route, opaque high-entropy capability
tokens stored hashed, version-pinned, expiring by default, revocable,
audited, rate-limited, swept — and served only through the CSP-locked
pipeline that already assumes its content is hostile.

## Current state

Plan 050 is implemented; re-verify its live contracts at pre-flight.

- **Revision chain (050, landed)**: `models/artifacts.py`
  `ArtifactRevision` has `create`/`edit`/`restore` kinds,
  exactly-one-actor and restore-source checks, unique ordered revisions,
  and an immutable `before_update` listener.
- **Jobs harness (030, landed)**: `services/jobs/registry.py:32-61`
  `job_handler` (duplicate kind → error at import, line 41); handlers
  auto-register via `from services.jobs import handlers` at
  `registry.py:68`; the consumer sweep precedent is
  `services/jobs/handlers/sweep_deleted_files.py:20-56`
  (`@job_handler(kind=..., timeout=300.0)`, self-reschedule via
  `enqueue_job`, `ensure_files_sweep_job` with a fixed `content_hash` for
  dedup); the worker calls each `ensure_*` per pass
  (`workers/job_runner.py:28-48`).
- **Rate limiter**: Postgres-backed upsert counter
  (`core/rate_limiting.py:138-188`), keyed `(ip_address, endpoint,
  limit_type, window_seconds, window_start)`; IP literal validated at
  `:96-109` (decision 4's sentinel constraint); dependency factory
  `require_rate_limit(limit_type, custom_limit, custom_window)` at
  `:414-445`; `get_client_ip` trusted-proxy resolution at `:356-384`.
- **Anonymous route precedent**: `routes/storage/private_object.py:15-29`
  (no auth dependency); CSRF enforcement is unsafe-methods-only
  (`middleware/csrf.py:64-69`) so a GET share route needs **no exempt-list
  change**; 050 already suppresses the csrf-cookie auto-refresh and
  X-Frame-Options default for the `/artifacts/shared` prefix
  (reserved in `_is_artifact_serving_path`).
- **Raw-path logging**: `middleware/request_logging.py:74` logs
  `request.url.path`; route template helper at `:19-25` (decision 7).
- **Token helpers**: `utils/security.py:70-96` `hash_token` /
  `verify_token_hash` (SHA-256 + `secrets.compare_digest`).
- **Audit**: writer `services/audit_events/operations.py:27-81`
  (workspace-scoped, actor typed, `safe_` wrapper);
  enums at `services/audit_events/enums.py:13-58` (no artifact resource
  types yet — this plan adds `ARTIFACT_SHARE`).
- **RBAC**: `require_owner` = MANAGER_ROLES (owner+admin),
  `require_editor` = +member (`core/dependencies.py:243-269`).
- **Settings validator**: production-safety `model_validator` at
  `core/settings/__init__.py:51-123` (decision 9's insertion point);
  local-only provider rejections at `:60-64` are the pattern to follow.
- **Frontend (disk state at `a0eea1c`)**:
  - Custom tool-row seam: `tool-call-row-registry.tsx:29-56`
    (`TOOL_CALL_ROW_DEFINITIONS`, matched in `renderCustomToolCallRow`);
    rows render from `message-row.tsx` via `ToolCallRow`; assistant turns
    group via `message-parts/group-render-items.ts:33-65`.
  - SSE parser throws on unknown events (`stream/sse.ts:73-75`);
    tool activities parse in `message-parts/parse.ts:179-227` — result
    content for a completed tool call lands in `activity.result`.
  - Routing is code-based (`src/app/router.tsx`, `lazyRouteComponent`,
    auth in `beforeLoad`); primary nav items live in
    `src/config/navigation.ts` (skills entry at line 44); admin gating
    precedent `features/workspaces/routes/workspace-settings-route.tsx:14`.
  - Data layer: one operation per `features/*/api/*.ts` file
    (`features/skills/api/` is the model); all requests via
    `src/lib/api/client.ts`; workspace-scoped query keys include the slug.
  - shadcn primitives available: `dialog`, `select`, `table`, `badge`,
    `alert`, `tabs`, `empty-state` (`src/components/ui/`).
- **Will exist after 050 (verify at pre-flight)**: `models/artifacts.py`
  (`Artifact` with `current_version_id` plus immutable
  `ArtifactRevision` rows), `services/artifacts/`
  (`serve_artifact_version.py`, `update_artifact.py`, schemas, CSP
  constants in `domain.py`), `routes/artifacts/` +
  `routes/artifact_serving/` (`/artifacts/view/...`),
  `GET /api/v1/artifacts/{id}/versions/{vid}/content`, and settings
  `ARTIFACT_ORIGIN` / `ARTIFACT_MAX_CONTENT_BYTES`.

## Scope

**In scope (API):**

- `apps/api/models/artifacts.py` (extend — add `ArtifactShare`) +
  `models/__init__.py` if the class needs registering

  `core/settings/__init__.py` (decision 9 validator rule)
- `apps/api/services/artifacts/` (add): `create_share.py`,
  `list_shares.py`, `revoke_share.py`, `resolve_share.py`,
  `restore_artifact_version.py`, share bits in `schemas.py`/`utils.py`
- `apps/api/services/jobs/handlers/sweep_expired_artifact_shares.py`

- `apps/api/middleware/request_logging.py` (decision 7 redaction)
- `apps/api/tests/`: `tests/services/artifacts/`, `tests/routes/artifacts/`,
  a middleware log-redaction test, factory helpers

**In scope (Web):**

- `apps/web/src/features/artifacts/` (create): `types.ts`;
  `api/list-artifacts.ts`, `api/get-artifact.ts`,
  `api/get-artifact-version-content.ts`, `api/update-artifact.ts`,
  `api/restore-artifact-version.ts`, `api/create-artifact-share.ts`,
  `api/list-artifact-shares.ts`, `api/revoke-artifact-share.ts`;

  (create) + `tool-call-row-registry.tsx` (one registry entry)
- `apps/web/src/app/router.tsx` (`/artifacts`, `/artifacts/$artifactId`),
  `src/config/navigation.ts` (nav entry)

**Out of scope (do NOT touch):**

- The serving pipeline's headers/CSP (owned by 050 — the share route calls
  it, never re-implements it); `ARTIFACT_CSP_CDN_HOSTS`.
- "Follow latest" shares, share passwords, per-share allowlists,
  download-count limits — all deferred until demanded.
- Public artifact discovery/indexing of any kind; `robots.txt` work.
- Artifact deletion routes and retention sweep for artifacts themselves
  (only *shares* are swept here; artifact lifecycle follows the files
  policy in a later slice).
- The interactive Apps system (donor §4.6 "Deferred").
- The CSRF enforcement exempt list, CORS config, cookie settings.
- Rich text/code editors, mermaid client-side rendering libraries.

## Git workflow

- Branch: `advisor/051-artifact-cards-share-links`
- Commit style: `API - Artifact Share Links` / `Web - Artifact Cards & Share Management`
  (two commits; API first so the web slice always has its backend)
- Do NOT push or open a PR unless the operator instructed it.

## Steps

### Step 1: Model, migration, settings

Add `ArtifactShare(Base, UUIDMixin, TimestampMixin)` to
`models/artifacts.py` (decision 8 — no soft-delete), `__tablename__ =
"artifact_shares"`:

- `workspace_id` UUID FK `workspaces.id` ondelete CASCADE, not null, indexed
- `artifact_id` UUID FK `artifacts.id` ondelete CASCADE, not null, indexed
- `version_id` UUID FK `file_revisions.id` ondelete CASCADE, **not null**
  (decision 2)
- `token_hash` String(64) not null, **unique** (the lookup index)
- `token_prefix` String(8) not null
- `expires_at` DateTime(tz) not null; `revoked_at` DateTime(tz) nullable
- `created_by_user_id` UUID FK `users.id` ondelete SET NULL, nullable-on-
  delete but required at insert; `revoked_by_user_id` same shape, nullable
- `last_accessed_at` DateTime(tz) nullable; `access_count` Integer not
  null server_default `0`, CHECK `access_count >= 0`

Indexes: unique `token_hash`; `(expires_at)` (sweep);
`(workspace_id, created_at)`. Core-branch migration against the live
`core@head` (D5); hand-check the unique index landed.

Settings (`core/settings/artifacts.py`): `ARTIFACT_SHARING_ENABLED: bool =
False`, `ARTIFACT_SHARE_DEFAULT_TTL_DAYS: int = 7` (governance §3),
`ARTIFACT_SHARE_MAX_TTL_DAYS: int = 30`. Add the decision 9 rule to the
production validator (`core/settings/__init__.py:51`): sharing enabled
outside `local` requires a non-empty `ARTIFACT_ORIGIN` whose host is
neither equal to nor a dot-suffix subdomain of the `APP_BASE_URL` /
`FRONTEND_URL` hosts.

**Verify**: `uv run alembic upgrade heads` + `alembic check` clean +
downgrade round-trip; `ARTIFACT_SHARING_ENABLED=true ENVIRONMENT=production
ARTIFACT_ORIGIN= uv run python -c "from core.settings import Settings; Settings()"`
→ raises the validator error (with the other prod-required env set);
same command with `ARTIFACT_ORIGIN=https://example-artifacts.com` and a
distinct app domain → constructs.

### Step 2: Share services

One operation per file in `services/artifacts/` (typed exceptions only):

- `create_share.py` — `create_artifact_share(db, *, request, workspace,
  membership, artifact_id, expires_in_days=None) -> tuple[ArtifactShare, str]`.
  Order matters: (1) reject when `not settings.ARTIFACT_SHARING_ENABLED`
  (`AppValidationError`); (2) load artifact workspace-scoped, not deleted
  (`NotFoundError`); (3) `check_workspace_share_rate_limit` (decision 4 —
  BEFORE token generation so blocked attempts burn nothing); (4) clamp TTL
  to `[1, ARTIFACT_SHARE_MAX_TTL_DAYS]`, default
  `ARTIFACT_SHARE_DEFAULT_TTL_DAYS`; (5) `token = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`,
  insert row (`token_hash`, `token_prefix=token[:8]`,
  `version_id=artifact.current_version_id`); (6) audit (action `CREATE`,
  resource `ARTIFACT_SHARE`, actor user, details: artifact_id, version_id,
  expires_at, token_prefix — **never the token**). Returns the row and the
  plain token; only the route composes the URL:
  `{ARTIFACT_ORIGIN or APP_BASE_URL}/artifacts/shared/{token}`.
- `list_shares.py` — active + revoked-unexpired shares for an artifact
  (prefix, expiry, creator, access_count, revoked state). Never exposes
  `token_hash`.
- `revoke_share.py` — sets `revoked_at`/`revoked_by_user_id` (idempotent:
  revoking twice is a no-op success); audit (action `DELETE`, resource
  `ARTIFACT_SHARE`).
- `resolve_share.py` — `resolve_artifact_share(db, *, token) ->
  tuple[ArtifactShare, Artifact]`: `hash_token(token)` → unique-index
  lookup → reject when `revoked_at IS NOT NULL` or `expires_at <= now()`
  or the artifact is soft-deleted — every rejection raises the SAME
  `NotFoundError("Share not found")` (decision 3). On success, perform the
  decision 6 atomic access-count UPDATE and (throttled) audit write.
- `restore_artifact_version.py` — appends an `ArtifactRevision` with
  `revision_kind="restore"` and `restored_from_revision_id`, then bumps
  `Artifact.current_version_id`. User actor provenance; do not call Files
  services.

Add `AuditResourceType.ARTIFACT_SHARE = "artifact_share"` to
`services/audit_events/enums.py`.

**Verify**: ruff exit 0; service tests in Step 8 cover behavior.

### Step 3: Routes

Management (under `/api/v1/artifacts`, route-per-file; roles per
decision 10):

- `create_share.py` — `POST /{artifact_id}/shares`
  (`Depends(require_owner)`) → 201 `{id, share_url, token_prefix,
  expires_at, version_id}`. `share_url` contains the token — the ONLY
  response that ever does.
- `list_shares.py` — `GET /{artifact_id}/shares` (`require_owner`)
- `revoke_share.py` — `DELETE /{artifact_id}/shares/{share_id}`
  (`require_owner`) → 204
- `update_artifact.py` — `PATCH /{artifact_id}` (`require_editor`) body
  `{content, title?}` → 050's `update_artifact` service, user actor
- `restore_version.py` — `POST /{artifact_id}/versions/{version_id}/restore`
  (`require_editor`) → Step 2 restore service

Anonymous serving: `routes/artifact_serving/serve_shared_artifact.py` —

```python
@router.get("/shared/{token}")
async def serve_shared_artifact(
    token: Annotated[str, Path(min_length=32, max_length=64)],
    db: AsyncDbSessionDep,
    download: Annotated[str | None, Query()] = None,
    _: None = Depends(require_rate_limit(custom_limit=120, custom_window=3600)),
) -> Response: ...
```

No auth dependency (precedent `routes/storage/private_object.py:15`).
Resolves via `resolve_share.py`, then serves the **pinned** `version_id`
through 050's `serve_artifact_version` pipeline — identical CSP/nosniff/
no-referrer/no-store headers, no `Set-Cookie` (the `/artifacts/shared`
prefix is already inside 050's middleware carve-outs). The route adds
nothing header-wise; it only swaps signature-auth for token-auth.

Apply the decision 7 log redaction in
`middleware/request_logging.py::_record_request`.

**Verify**: manual curl round-trip — create share as admin (with
`ARTIFACT_SHARING_ENABLED=true` locally), open `share_url` with NO cookies
→ 200 + 050's exact headers; revoke → same URL 404; member role creating a
share → 403; 11th create in an hour → 429 with `Retry-After`.

### Step 4: Sweep

`services/jobs/handlers/sweep_expired_artifact_shares.py`, cloning the
`sweep_deleted_files.py:20-56` shape:

```python
SWEEP_EXPIRED_ARTIFACT_SHARES_KIND = "artifacts.sweep_expired_shares"

@job_handler(kind=SWEEP_EXPIRED_ARTIFACT_SHARES_KIND, timeout=120.0)
async def sweep_expired_artifact_shares(db, job):
    # DELETE FROM artifact_shares WHERE expires_at < now()  (revoked included)
    # then self-reschedule via enqueue_job(run_after=now + interval)

async def ensure_artifact_shares_sweep_job(db): ...  # fixed content_hash dedup
```

Wire `ensure_artifact_shares_sweep_job` into the worker pass beside
`ensure_files_sweep_job` (`workers/job_runner.py:28-48`). Idempotent by
design (at-least-once execution — 030's rule for all handlers).

**Verify**: the Commands-table registry check prints `True`;
`uv run python -m workers.job_runner --once` exits 0 and logs the shares
sweep; expired rows (incl. revoked) deleted, live rows kept (Step 8 test).

### Step 5: Frontend — artifacts feature core

`features/artifacts/types.ts`: `Artifact`, `ArtifactVersion`,
`ArtifactShare` (with `token_prefix`, never a token field),
`ArtifactContent` — `type` aliases only (lint rule).

API modules (one operation each, `queryOptions` + `useSuspenseQuery` for
reads, `useMutation` + invalidation for writes, workspace slug in every
query key, all through `lib/api/client.ts`): the eight files listed in
Scope. `create-artifact-share.ts` holds the returned `share_url` in
component state only — it must never be written into the query cache
(it cannot be re-fetched, and cached copies outlive the dialog).

Components:

- `artifact-preview-frame.tsx` — THE sandbox chokepoint, used by chat cards
  and the detail view: html → `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts"
  srcDoc={content} title={title} />` (no `allow-same-origin`, no
  `allow-popups`, no `allow-forms`, no `allow-top-navigation`); markdown →
  the existing `MessageMarkdown` renderer; csv → parse-and-render via the
  existing `markdown-table.tsx` treatment; mermaid → read-only code block
  (client-side mermaid rendering is out of scope); image-ref → `<img>`
  from the signed URL. A lint-greppable comment forbids
  `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in this feature.
- `artifact-version-selector.tsx` (shadcn `select`, newest first, current
  badge), `artifact-diff.tsx` (decision 11), `artifact-edit-dialog.tsx`
  (decision 12 textarea), `artifacts-table.tsx`, `artifact-detail.tsx`
  (preview + version selector + diff/restore + shares section).

Routes/nav: `/artifacts` + `/artifacts/$artifactId` in
`src/app/router.tsx` (`lazyRouteComponent`, auth `beforeLoad` like the
skills routes); nav entry in `src/config/navigation.ts` beside Skills.

**Verify**: `pnpm check` passes; manual: artifacts page lists a seeded
artifact; detail shows versions; restore creates a new head version; edit
appends a revision.

### Step 6: Frontend — chat artifact cards

`features/conversations/components/artifact-tool-row.tsx`: renders a card
for `create_artifact`/`update_artifact` tool activities — status shell via
the existing `tool-activity-row-shell.tsx`, then (when
`activity.status === "completed"` and `activity.result` carries
`artifact_id`/`version_id`) title, type badge, an inline
`ArtifactPreviewFrame` fed by `get-artifact-version-content.ts`, a version
selector, and an "Open" link to `/artifacts/$artifactId`. Pending-approval
and denied states keep the standard tool-row treatment (the approval
controls already render for approval-required tools — do not fork that
path). Guard result parsing with `lib/guards.ts` helpers — tool results
are untrusted JSON.

Register it in `tool-call-row-registry.tsx` (`TOOL_CALL_ROW_DEFINITIONS`,
the 020 seam):

```ts
{
  key: "artifact",
  matches: (activity) =>
    activity.name === "create_artifact" || activity.name === "update_artifact",
  render: ({ activity, compact, defaultOpen }) => (
    <ArtifactToolRow activity={activity} compact={compact} defaultOpen={defaultOpen} />
  ),
}
```

No SSE protocol changes of any kind (decision 15).

**Verify**: `pnpm check` passes (dependency-cruiser: conversations →
artifacts feature import must not create a cycle — artifacts must not
import from conversations); manual: asking an agent with the tool enabled
to create an HTML artifact yields an approval row, then a rendered
sandboxed card; the iframe element in devtools shows
`sandbox="allow-scripts"` only.

### Step 7: Frontend — share management

`artifact-share-dialog.tsx` (create: expiry select 1/7/30 d capped by the
API, then a one-time copy-URL state with an explicit "you won't see this
again" note) and `artifact-shares-list.tsx` (prefix, expiry, creator,
access count, revoked badge, revoke button with confirm). Mounted in
`artifact-detail.tsx`, rendered only when
`workspace.current_user_role` is `owner`/`admin` (decision 10 gating,
`workspace-settings-route.tsx:14` pattern); the API remains the real
enforcement. When share creation returns the sharing-disabled validation
error, show it verbatim (no client-side feature flag — the API is the
source of truth).

**Verify**: `pnpm check`; manual: admin creates a share, copies the URL,
opens it in a private window (no session) → document renders; revoke →
private window reload → 404; member account sees no shares section.

### Step 8: Tests (API)

`tests/services/artifacts/` + `tests/routes/artifacts/` + one middleware
test (async modules set `pytestmark = pytest.mark.asyncio`; DB tests skip
without `TEST_DATABASE_URL`):

- `test_create_share.py`: token ≥ 32 chars URL-safe; row stores
  `hash_token(token)`, never the token (grep the row + audit details);
  version pinned to `current_version_id`; TTL default 7 d and clamped at
  max; sharing disabled → validation error; member → 403, admin/owner →
  201; **rate limit**: 10 creates succeed, the 11th → 429 with
  `X-RateLimit-*`/`Retry-After`, and a second workspace is unaffected
  (the sentinel key is workspace-scoped).
- `test_serve_shared_artifact.py` (the anonymous surface — pinned
  invariants):
  - valid token, no cookies → 200; headers equal 050's serving header set
    **exactly** (CSP byte-match against the `domain.py` constants,
    `nosniff`, `no-referrer`, `no-store`); **no `Set-Cookie`** even when a
    valid `session` cookie is sent.
  - revoked → 404; expired → 404; unknown token → 404; artifact
    soft-deleted → 404 — and all four response bodies are **identical**
    (uniform problem+json, decision 3).
  - version pinning: `update_artifact` after share creation; the share
    still serves the old revision's bytes.
  - access accounting: two accesses within an hour → `access_count == 2`,
    exactly ONE `artifact_share` READ audit row (decision 6); a third
    access with `last_accessed_at` backdated > 1 h → second audit row.
- `test_share_lifecycle.py`: revoke idempotent; revoke audited; list
  excludes swept rows and never leaks `token_hash`.
- `test_sweep_expired_artifact_shares.py`: expired live + expired revoked
  rows deleted, unexpired kept; handler re-enqueues itself; `ensure_*`
  idempotent (dedup index).
- `test_restore_and_edit.py`: user edit appends a user-actor revision
  (exactly-one-actor satisfied); restore appends `revision_kind="restore"`
  with `restored_from_revision_id`, bumps `current_version_id`, and the
  restored-from revision is byte-identical in storage; editor role
  required (read_only → 403).
- `tests/middleware/test_request_log_redaction.py`: caplog on a
  `/artifacts/shared/<token>` request never contains the token; the
  logged `url` is the route template.

**Verify**: `TEST_DATABASE_URL=... uv run pytest tests/services/artifacts
tests/routes/artifacts tests/middleware -q` all pass;
`cd apps/web && pnpm check` exits 0.

## Test plan

Covered by Step 8's focused API suite plus frontend unit coverage for
artifact preview safety, bounded markdown rendering, and quoted CSV parsing.
Pinned invariants: **tokens exist in exactly one response and nowhere else**
(not rows, not audits, not logs, not query cache), **anonymous responses are
uniform and cookie-free** (identical 404s; 050 header set byte-matched; no
Set-Cookie), **shares are pinned, expiring, revocable, and swept** (pin
survives edits; revoke/expiry → 404; sweeper hard-deletes per governance §3
while audit rows survive), **limits hold per workspace** (10/h creation via
the sentinel key; per-IP access throttle), and **the revision chain stays
append-only** (edits and restores add revisions; nothing mutates).

## Done criteria

- [ ] `uv run ruff check .` exits 0; `uv run alembic check` clean;
      migration on the **core** branch (D5); downgrade round-trips
- [ ] `TEST_DATABASE_URL=... uv run pytest tests/services/artifacts tests/routes/artifacts tests/middleware -q` exits 0
- [ ] `artifacts.sweep_expired_shares` registered; `workers.job_runner
      --once` runs it; sweep test green
- [ ] Share create/list/revoke are admin+; edit/restore are member+;
      the anonymous route has no auth dependency and required no CSRF
      exempt-list change (`git diff apps/api/middleware/csrf.py` empty)
- [ ] The share URL token appears only in the 201 response; log-redaction
      test green
- [ ] Production validator rejects sharing without a distinct-origin
      `ARTIFACT_ORIGIN`
- [ ] `cd apps/web && pnpm check` exits 0 (typecheck, eslint 0 warnings,
      prettier, knip, depcruise, build)
- [ ] `grep -rn "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" apps/web/src/features/artifacts apps/web/src/features/conversations` → no matches;
      every artifact iframe sets `sandbox="allow-scripts"` and nothing more
- [ ] No new SSE event names (`stream/protocol.ts` untouched)
- [ ] Security-auditor review of the share slice completed and recorded in
      the PR description
- [ ] `docs/architecture/governance.md` §1 (share links), §3 (shares row),
      §4 (share rate limit) flipped to `[implemented: plan 051]`
- [ ] `git status` clean outside the in-scope list;
      `docs/plans/000_README.md` row updated

## STOP conditions

Stop and report back (do not improvise) if:

- Plan 050 is not implemented, or its landed shape diverges from the
  pre-flight expectations (no `serve_artifact_version` seam reusable by a
  token-resolved caller; `/artifacts/shared` prefix not carved out in the
  middleware; CSP constants not centralized in `domain.py`).
- An `artifact_shares` table or any share/token code already exists.
- `core/rate_limiting.py` no longer accepts the decision 4 sentinel
  pattern (e.g. IP validation tightened, keying changed) — do not fork the
  limiter; report.
- The jobs harness handler assembly (`services/jobs/registry.py:68`,
  `workers/job_runner.py` ensure-calls) has changed shape since `a0eea1c`.
- The uniform-404 requirement cannot be met (e.g. an exception handler
  decorates 404s with resource-specific detail) — fix the leak first.
- Serving a share response emits `Set-Cookie` or non-050 headers under any
  request shape — the cookie-freedom invariant is non-negotiable.
- The governance note's §1/§3/§4 share defaults changed (roles, 7 d expiry,
  10/hour) — reconcile before coding.
- Implementing log redaction requires touching more than
  `_record_request` — a broader logging refactor is not this plan.
- You feel the need to add a viewer wrapper page, "follow latest" shares,
  a new SSE event, or client-side mermaid rendering — scope creep; record
  a follow-up instead.

## Maintenance notes

- **First-anonymous-surface precedent**: any future anonymous route must
  match this bar — capability tokens stored hashed, uniform 404s, no
  cookies, rate-limited, swept, audited, log-redacted. Cite this plan's
  Step 8 invariants as the checklist.
- **Sentinel rate-limit key**: if a second per-workspace limit appears
  (e.g. 032's storage quota enforcement or a future API budget), promote
  the decision 4 wrapper into a first-class `subject`-keyed limiter API in
  `core/rate_limiting.py` and migrate both callers — do not copy the
  sentinel a third time.
- **Access-audit throttle** (1 row/share/hour) is a tunable, not a law; if
  ops need finer grain, drop the throttle behind a setting rather than
  widening audit writes silently. `access_count` remains exact regardless.
- **"Follow latest" shares** (nullable `version_id`) are the only
  anticipated schema relaxation; they must NOT ship without an explicit
  UI affordance showing share consumers see future edits.
- **Deferred interactive Apps** (donor §4.6) stay deferred; share links do
  not grow postMessage bridges, embed SDKs, or iframe APIs.
- **Separate-origin enforcement** now lives in the settings validator
  (decision 9). If deployment later terminates the artifact origin at a
  CDN or separate service, the validator rule and 050's reverse-proxy
  guidance must be updated together.
- Reviewers should scrutinize: `resolve_share.py`'s single-exception
  discipline (one `NotFoundError` for all rejection causes), the atomic
  access-count UPDATE (no read-modify-write race), that `share_url` never
  enters the TanStack Query cache, that the registry card matcher cannot
  shadow the delegation/skill rows (registry order in
  `tool-call-row-registry.tsx` is first-match-wins), and that the sweep
  deletes revoked-but-unexpired rows only after `expires_at`.

## Execution record (2026-07-28)

Completed as the next serial roadmap item. The implementation uses the
dedicated `ArtifactRevision` aggregate landed by 050; the plan's stale
`file_revisions` foreign-key wording was resolved to `artifact_revisions`
without crossing into Files ownership.

The mandatory independent security audit initially found raw capability paths
in rate-limit keys and secondary logs, per-token rather than shared guess
budgets, malformed-token 422s, incomplete same-site isolation, and a
configurable TTL above the 30-day ceiling. Its re-audits additionally required
HTTPS, active rate limiting, and suppression of Uvicorn's raw access log.
All findings were fixed and regression-tested; the final audit reported no
remaining findings.

Verification completed with a core migration upgrade/downgrade/upgrade
round-trip, Alembic drift check, registered sweep and one-pass worker smoke,
the focused database-backed artifact/middleware suite, the full API and web
repository gate, grep checks for sandbox/HTML injection constraints, and
unchanged CSRF/SSE protocol files.

A post-completion implementation review fixed two operator-facing version
ambiguities: share creation now states explicitly that it pins the current
head revision, including while an older revision is selected, and successful
edits move the detail view to the newly appended revision. The same follow-up
consolidated markdown and diff rendering into shared components, added bounded
markdown and standards-compliant quoted CSV previews, expanded the pinned API
invariant coverage, and refreshed the root capability documentation.
